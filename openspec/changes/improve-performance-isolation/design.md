# Performance audit and implementation design

## Initial audit boundary

Baseline: `69a8098d84ae58d616f988f5662e6038afdcf0e0`, inspected 2026-10-30.
The first step is a source audit and plan, not a fresh benchmark or runtime fix.
The reported direction is specifically slowed non-master PADs with BPM Lock and
Key Lock; faster PADs and the master are controls. Generation, postprocessing,
component loading and live adoption must be measured separately.

## Source findings

| Finding | Evidence | Implication and next verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fixed preparation scheduling lead | `pitch_runtime.rs`: `PREPARATION_LEAD_FRAMES`, `execution_frame`, `next_replan`, `accept_ordinary` | An already-due start needing a worker is planned at callback +8192 frames: 185.76 ms at 44.1 kHz, 170.67 ms at 48 kHz, 85.33 ms at 96 kHz. These are arithmetic scheduling costs, not measured input latency. Measure hit/miss and E-T on the actual ordinary route. |
| Single-use, selected-only reserve | `ordinary_endpoint_reserve.rs`: `transfer_to`; `mixer/endpoint_reserve.rs`: `capture_selected_normal_endpoint` | Only the selected Normal endpoint has one candidate; consumption requires replenishment. Unselected/repeated starts can miss. Bounded multi-PAD readiness needs explicit memory/ownership admission. |
| Two-stage capture and groups | `audio_stream.rs`: `CapturePadStartTarget`, `PreparedStart`; `pitch_runtime.rs`: `accept_ordinary`, `accept_group`; Python `transport/residency.py`: captured preparation/ACK/publication | A past original target excludes even a matching reserve. Atomic groups OR their members' preparation needs without a reserve-hit route. Preserve original input/T and one common actual E; measure GUI and native MIDI separately. |
| Unity bypass and direction | `mixer/ordinary_start.rs`: `requires_ordinary_start_preparation`; `pitch_intent.rs`: `native_pitch_scale` | Native scale is h/r with Key Lock and h without it. Master r=1/h=1 bypasses preparation; slowed r<1 requires upward Native compensation. The fixed lead affects both nonunity directions and alone does not explain a slower-only symptom. |
| Prepared does not mean attack-compensated | `retained_native_start.rs`: physical-birth silent priming; `key_lock_physical_onset_tests.rs`; existing latency example | Warmed handles do not prove principal-attack alignment. Separate first sound, significant onset and principal attack from nominal Native delay. Existing onset/quality failures remain open. |
| Serial preparation and serial render | `pitch_actions/preparation.rs`: worker loop; `key_lock_preparation.rs`: worker lanes; `mixer.rs`: `render_rt_chunk` | Independent worker work is partly serial, and voices render serially in the callback. Measure worker queue tails and callback cost before adding concurrency; a blocking general threadpool inside the callback is unsuitable. |
| Stem I/O holds global owners | `committed_stem_residency.rs`: `current_owners`, `prepare`, `request_committed_stem_residency_with_interest_and_producer`; public wrappers in `audio_engine/mod.rs` | Preparation retains the global owners guard across component reads/allocation. A request can acquire the shared producer then wait for owners under the GIL. Test slow component reads while another PAD triggers/stops; reduce lock scope without weakening admission. This is a control stall risk, not evidence of a callback mutex. |
| Python postprocessing | `controller/stem_artifacts.py`: `_read_span`, `_align_block`, `_payload`, `_instrumental_payload`; both generation backends | Bounded 4096-frame blocks still perform per-sample Python work in App worker threads. Port the arithmetic/streaming path under a detached Rust boundary; measure GUI/control progress as well as throughput. |
| Inference separation lacks CPU budgeting | `stem_workers.py`, `stem_generation.py`: `demucs_cache_environment`; `stem_process.py`; `analysis/process.py`: `_environment`, `run_owned_command` | Two stem workers can run broad child/native thread pools. Beat-worker BLAS caps do not apply to the generic stem route. Process-tree custody is already implemented; it is not a CPU reservation. Measure inference, conversion and loading separately. |
| Finite/shared PCM already implemented | `stem_pair.rs`: component view preparation; `resident_accounting.rs`; `cold_jobs.rs`; `committed_stem_residency.rs` | Direct Arc allocation, immutable reuse, scoped unique accounting, pending promises, host headroom and bounded cold workers already exist. Profile process RSS/private commit/paging and last-reader plateaus rather than rebuild these foundations. |
| CUDA and fallback already exist | `bs_roformer_generation.py`, `stem_generation.py`, offline worker code | Preserve actual device/fallback receipts. Additional offline acceleration needs transfer-inclusive evidence; no measured case currently supports moving small callback blocks to CUDA. |

## Measurement contract

Record original monotonic input capture, control admission/publication, requested
output target T, actual effect E, first significant rendered output and principal
attack against a matched dry/source reference. Keep authored silence and genuine
source attack position; do not trim audio to improve a latency number. Report
first nonzero and relative-threshold onset separately so pre-ringing cannot pass
as a responsive attack. Declare each fixture's authored onset/silence. Record
rejected/cancelled starts and missing or ambiguous attacks.

The engineering goal is <=30 ms input-to-significant-rendered-output response for
ready, quantization-OFF starts on a declared reference machine/profile at 2/4/6
PADs, with attack displacement reported separately and no lost beginning or audible
dry/wet substitution. Quantization-ON reports intentional grid wait separately,
then excess lateness relative to T. Device/driver/input transport buffering and
physical loopback are separate components, never silently subtracted or claimed
from a software result. Cold/refused/unavailable domains remain explicit and are
not dropped from aggregate reports to make a warm result look universal.

For fixtures with an authored attack at the beginning, evaluate principal-attack
response against the same 30 ms goal. For later authored attacks, compare their
displacement against the matched dry/source reference. Significant output alone
cannot pass the target if the principal attack remains late; report that case
as unmet, and ambiguous or missing attacks as unresolved/failed evidence.

Use 44.1/48/96 kHz where supported, actual and irregular callback partitions,
rates 1, 0.8 and 1.16 plus existing 0.5/0.75/1.5/2 DSP cases, Key Lock ON/OFF and
BPM Lock ON/OFF. Include ordinary PAD/Piano retrigger, START/STOP, selected and
unselected PADs, cold/warm/rapid repeats, atomic groups, pause/resume, loops,
one-shot, Intro/Tail, full mix and selected stems. Add Stop/cancel, source or stem
replacement, rate/pitch changes and queue/reserve pressure where touched.

Compare no background work, inference, conversion, component loading and mixed
jobs. Report sample counts, p50/p95/p99/max capture-to-effect/onset and callback
durations, callback deadline misses, FIFO underflows, reserve hits/refusals,
worker queue waits, CPU usage, working set/private commit, native owners/handles
and repeated-cycle plateaus. Stress at most 10 PADs; 2/4/6 is the productive
target. Internal 32-owner correctness is not a performance workload.

Reuse `examples/key_lock_latency_probe.rs` for Native/adapter diagnostics and
existing production ordinary-start, endpoint, group, onset and source-history
tests. Extend the missing captured ordinary end-to-end route rather than invent
a second scheduler. Reuse `c3_process_metrics.rs` for host counters; do not rerun
the historical 200-PAD loader program as audio acceptance. Native/FFT allocations
are outside the existing Rust allocation counter's scope.

## Proposed implementation boundaries

### Responsive starts

Prefer preparation before a performer press and bounded exact-source readiness.
First measure the two-phase ordinary path and selected reserve rejection for
past-T inputs. A safe immediate late birth must retain its physical beginning,
fresh effect-time checks and one common E for atomic groups. Never just reduce
8192 or move preparation, reset, allocation, blocking or file reads into realtime.

If warmed resources still fail the attack target, evaluate source-bound prepared
attack material or another CPU DSP design using the same production-route
measurements and retained quality gates. Share only immutable data; each attack
owns its mutable Native/FIFO/filter state. Existing isolated backend experiments
are evidence, not an accepted backend or authority to bypass source history.

### Independent stem preparation and controls

Separate per-content admission/reservation from slow I/O, then revalidate source,
placement, intent and memory under short publication locks. Merely detaching a
blocking wrapper frees Python but can leave the shared control producer blocked;
the test must prove unrelated trigger and STOP progress during an injected read.
Retain same-PAD serialization, OwnACK, cancellation, candidate identity, pending
promises, shared reuse and outgoing/history last readers.

### Detached Rust conversion

Port the bounded model-output conversion path, keeping Python orchestration.
Keep Rust domain types, cancellation/progress and processing logic independent
of PyO3; expose thin validated bindings rather than Python objects inside the
core. Reuse the native logic from Rust tests and future native orchestration.
Keep common logic portable across Windows, Linux and macOS. Put process-tree
control, device/backend integration and OS-specific resource observations behind
platform adapters/conditional modules. Use typed paths and standard portable file
semantics; do not spread Windows DLL/path/priority assumptions into the core.
CPU inference/rendering is the portable baseline, CUDA an optional capability.
Preserve binary64 resampling/channel mapping, exact PCM16 MIN/endpoints and
ties-even rounding, nonfinite handling, ordered intermediate clipping of the
instrumental sum, RIFF/RF64 and output geometry. Retain exclusive private output,
cooperative cancellation, failure cleanup, provenance/fingerprints, complete hash
verification and descriptor-last eligibility. Version processing identity when
the executed implementation changes even if tested bytes are equal.

### Background resources and robustness

Coordinate separator, BLAS/Torch, FFmpeg, conversion and analysis concurrency
against available host resources, reserving audio/control headroom. Apply child
settings before native libraries initialize and verify effective settings; do
not mutate global App numerical settings. Keep process-tree cancellation and
same-model CPU fallback. If bounded overlap cannot meet callback deadlines,
defer/gate heavy generation during playback with truthful pending UI and specs;
do not silently stop active PADs. The Human explicitly accepts a robust gated
policy over unreliable concurrent generation.
Fallback must not disguise cancellation or malformed/corrupt input as a CUDA
device failure; preserve those terminal outcomes.

### Memory, multicore and CUDA decisions

Measure unique PCM versus process/native/model memory, preparation bursts, sharing
and final-reader release. Consider bounded independent preparation lanes or
native batch/SIMD work only where callback tails and memory improve. Do not
parallelize merely to occupy every core. Keep one time authority and deterministic
effects. Offline GPU additions require transfer-inclusive benefit, bounded VRAM,
actual CUDA execution and a verified CPU path; retain a usable CPU-only install.

The Human additionally authorizes as much sensible Rust migration as useful for
performance, dependency footprint and eventual Windows EXE distribution. Audit
actual PyTorch model/operator use and replacement seams rather than assume a
language port removes the tensor runtime. A replacement must preserve model
weights/processing identity, numerical/quality behavior, device receipts, CPU
fallback, cancellation and distribution/recovery. Compare package size, startup,
RAM, inference speed and maintenance cost. Keep further migration easy, but do
not delete PyTorch or promise a smaller/faster package before those proofs.
Future packaging targets Windows EXE as well as Linux and macOS distributions.
Review native audio/inference libraries, CPU architectures and provider availability
on each OS; distinguish actual platform build/run evidence from design intent.
Do not infer Linux/macOS support from Windows-only tests or make CUDA mandatory.
Keep GPU selection capability/provider-based rather than hard-code NVIDIA versus
CPU. Investigate AMD-capable providers and implement a practical equivalent path
when operator support, packaging, quality and transfer-inclusive performance fit.
Provider availability depends on OS/architecture/GPU/driver; absence or provider
device failure must retain CPU fallback without hiding corrupt input/cancellation.
The official ONNX Runtime [DirectML](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/DirectML-ExecutionProvider.html)
and [MIGraphX](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/MIGraphX-ExecutionProvider.html)
provider references are candidate starting points, not proof our pinned runtime
or models support them. Record actual AMD execution separately from mocked tests;
do not require a new GPU runtime in the common CPU-only installation.

The follow-up request makes practical PyTorch removal an explicit investigation
and implementation target, conditional on feasibility and retaining at least
current functionality, model quality and interactions. KeyNet already uses Rust
CQT plus ONNX Runtime; its offline Torch export is not productive inference.
Stem separation and the separate BeatThis workers still use full Torch model
pipelines. A LibTorch binding would not eliminate that runtime. Investigate
replacement artifacts/operators using the existing native inference pattern;
preserve exact frontend/chunk/tail/overlap semantics, pinned-weight provenance,
CPU and available CUDA execution/fallback, resource limits and quality evidence.
Remove runtime/dependency closures only after parity and distribution checks;
split substantial model migrations into coherent chats rather than weaken the
no-regression condition. If replacement is not practical, retain the functioning
path and record the concrete operator, quality or packaging barrier.

Primary upstream context, checked during this audit:
[Rubber Band LiveShifter](https://www.breakfastquay.com/rubberband/code-doc/classRubberBand_1_1RubberBandLiveShifter.html)
documents configuration-dependent processing delay and per-instance thread safety;
[PyTorch CPU oversubscription](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/2.15/notes/multiprocessing.html#cpu-in-multiprocessing)
and [thread initialization](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/2.15/generated/torch.set_num_threads.html)
support setting child budgets before work. These explain mechanisms, not measured
application results or an instruction to change pinned dependencies.

## Verification and architectural records

Each implementation step updates the affected current spec/module, preserves the
single clock, immutable source/content identity, independent PAD/voice state,
effect-time validation, OwnACK and off-callback last-reader retirement. Review
GUI/native MIDI, load/restore/persistence, Hold/pause/EOF, failure/stale/ABA and
shared-resource interactions proportionally. Portable review accompanies actual
ABI/dependency/runtime-path changes; no pin or toolchain update is assumed.

Use bounded Systems PRE/frozen POST, Methods review and one independent final
actual-diff review. Root serializes writes/Git/build/install. Run focused checks
for each coherent change and the combined matrix at the final boundary; reuse
unchanged compatible evidence. Protect running Apps, held Native and private
audio/settings. Headless checks do not establish listening/device acceptance.
