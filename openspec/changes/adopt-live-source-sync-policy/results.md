## Stage 0: compact existing master projection, 2026-10-23

The existing mapped source clock now retains a 32-byte immutable projection
extracted by TransportTimeline instead of copying the whole mutable transport.
Its four fields are exactly the existing beat/epoch inputs. The binary64
expression order, original phase/marker, pause address translation, master
continuation anchors, ownership and exact continuity guards remain unchanged.
This adds no policy adoption, converter, audio owner or second clock.

Current coherent source change: transport.rs, mapped_source_clock.rs and their
mapped-clock/playback tests. New transport tests compare projection bits with
the unchanged original TransportTimeline evaluator across fractional periods,
negative/positive anchors and large frames through u64::MAX; check all four
epoch inputs, signed zero and missing master; and distinguish frozen projection
from unrelated progress/display/bootstrap state. The new mapped test compares
original master arithmetic at distant addresses and preserves marker/phase fences.

### Fresh verification

Commands use the existing environment/buildcache and
scripts/run-rust-tests.ps1 -CargoArgs with --release --locked --lib. Each selected
looper test set is disjoint; filtered analysis-crate zero-test output adds no pass.

| Affected native set | Result |
| --- | --- |
| audio_engine::transport::tests | 40 PASS, 0 FAIL/IGNORE; compile 3m07s, tests <0.01s |
| audio_engine::mapped_source_clock::tests, including copied SourcePlayback | 21 PASS, 0 FAIL/IGNORE; 0.01s |
| mapped_dry_global_rate_tests, including two-owner cohort | 8 PASS, 0 FAIL/IGNORE; 5.15s |
| mapped_hold_continuation_tests, including ordinary Pause/Resume | 17 PASS, 0 FAIL/IGNORE; 16.58s |
| mapped_fixed_pitch_birth_tests | 6 PASS, 0 FAIL/IGNORE; 11.63s |

Total: **92 distinct native PASS**, including four new test functions. Existing
canonical position/PCM/partition, pause/master-change, admission and owner guards
remain in these tests. Python source/API/persistence behavior is unchanged; the
prior compatible Python evidence is retained, not reported as freshly rerun here.

Measured fixed layout: projection 32 B; mapped epoch 88 B; mapped span 176 B
(previously 224 B, still <=240); SourcePlayback 288 B; 32-lane optional playback
copy 9,216 B (still <=16 KiB); checkpoint 448 B. The historical-span payload
measurement explicitly excludes Native/PCM, allocator/Arc/ring and inline Work
overhead; these sizes do not prove whole-process RSS or 216-PAD resource acceptance.

Release all-targets Clippy PASS, 48.62s; existing warnings 96 lib / 131 lib-test
(56 duplicates) / 196 example. Warning sites in touched paths refer to unchanged
old fields/methods/test bodies; no lint suppression was added. Cargo fmt, both
included-test rustfmt checks, strict OpenSpec and whitespace checks PASS.

One normal private Release wheel built in 43.36s (39 existing lib warnings).
Fresh private-origin import/profile and all 13 existing Portable API checks PASS,
including editor API4 and ordinary transport. Private Native: 34,440,704 B,
SHA256 `51014911a1a0a88aeb87baef1cb661bdd3b4f39076a31b080f600f81ff3b0ee1`.
It was not installed. The actual previously installed Native remains byte-identical
at 34,446,848 B / `91881c187435c0bad0e2c6382a901f7af5c6585caf3665e0da1b6928ac35e6ab`;
the canonical start.bat --check also PASS on that explicitly unchanged installation.
No App/device was started or stopped, and no held Native was replaced.

### Actual negative results and limits

- Initial formatting check found new test assertion layout; targeted rustfmt fixed it.
- The first wrapper invocation failed at PowerShell parameter binding because -p
  was ambiguous. Explicit -CargoArgs fixed invocation; that attempt ran no tests.
- First actual native compilation found six direct epoch.timeline references in
  the included playback fixture. They now use the same original 100-Hz/1-second
  fixture timeline; assertions and product guards were preserved. The full affected
  compile/test sets above passed after that fix.
- Two exact rational arithmetic counterexamples reproduce fraction-bit loss when
  combining integer/fraction, and in the old noninteger-musical scalar projection
  at zero elapsed output. They are arithmetic evidence, not an engine or audio test.
  The compact projection does not resolve or conceal either conversion gap.

One continuous independent NONAUTHOR final-diff review returned CLEAR for staged
tree `4eb8b06545265752c64bce37fb08a8e198b25686`, including actual receipts and hashes,
and explicitly covers this factual CLEAR receipt and final Stage-0 task checkbox.
The reviewer made no source changes or test/build/Git mutations.

Stage A's anchored numerical domain/algorithm/error/wrap/actual-PCM and reverse
scalar contract remains open. Stage B's original-custody live policy/map adoption,
32-lane freshness/atomicity/retry and actual feedback remain open. Global SYNC and
Realtime BPM are not complete. All original/extension/Human/Native/pitch/Key-Lock/
B2/music/device/resource/parent/final gates remain; STOP full Rust-port work/Slice8.
