## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Hello World Label
**Reason**: Replace placeholder content with the performance UI layout.
**Migration**: The primary content window will render the performance view instead.

#### Scenario: UI shell no longer requires the placeholder label
- **WHEN** the UI is started
- **THEN** the text "hello world" is not required to be visible
